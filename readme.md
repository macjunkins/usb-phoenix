# üéõ AcreetionOS USB Flasher - Project "Phoenix"

## üß≠ What This Is

A production-ready USB flasher specifically for AcreetionOS, built to provide a trustworthy and polished installation experience. This project represents my commitment to making Linux installation accessible and reliable in support of the AcreetionOS Team.

**Current Status:** I'm hardening and polishing an existing Electron-based flasher to create a solid MVP that can be confidently recommended to users.

## üéØ Why I'm Building This

AcreetionOS deserves a USB flasher that:

* **Protects users** from common flashing mistakes
* **Looks and feels trustworthy** to new Linux users
* **Can evolve** into a broader tool for the Linux community
* **Supports the team's growth** as they attract contributors, donors, and sponsors

This isn't just about flashing ISOs ‚Äî it's about creating a professional first impression for the AcreetionOS operating system.

## üèó Current Focus: MVP Development

### What I'm Building Now

A production-ready version of the Acreetion Media Creator that focuses on **AcreetionOS only**, with:

* **Security**: Safe disk selection, proper permission handling, checksum verification
* **Polish**: Clean, professional UI that's beginner-friendly
* **Focus**: Single-purpose tool for AcreetionOS ISOs

### Key Features

| Area | What I'm Delivering |
|------|----------------------|
| **Image Handling** | Auto-detect latest AcreetionOS ISO; manual selection as fallback |
| **Drive Detection** | Show drive labels/capacity; exclude internal/system disks by default |
| **Checksum Verification** | Auto-verify SHA256 and display results before flashing |
| **Flash Process** | Simple progress bar with logs and clear error messages |
| **Final Screen** | Success state with reboot instructions and support links |
| **Packaging** | Native installers for Windows/macOS/Linux with proper signing |

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 16+ and npm
* Git
* Basic familiarity with command line

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd usb-phoenix
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development version:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Building for Distribution

```bash
