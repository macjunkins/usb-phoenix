# 🎛 Acreetion Media Creator: From Hobby Tool to Production-Ready Utility

## 🧭 Why This Exists

AcreetionOS deserves a simple, secure USB flasher that we can confidently recommend to new users. Right now, we’ve got a great starting point — a working Electron-based app that was built by one of our founders. It proves the concept and shows how much we care about user experience.

But as the OS grows — and especially if we want to attract contributors, donors, or sponsors — the install flow needs to be bulletproof. We need a flasher that:

* Protects the user from mistakes
* Looks and feels trustworthy
* Can evolve into something more

This guide outlines a plan to:

1. Ship a polished MVP using what we already have
2. Explore Rust + Tauri as a long-term foundation
3. Do it all with respect for what’s been built — and room to stop at any time if it doesn’t make sense

---

## 🧪 MVP Overview: What We’re Building Now

### 🔧 What It Is

A production-ready version of Acreetion Media Creator that focuses on flashing **AcreetionOS only**, with a clean UX and safer technical foundation.

### ✨ Key Goals

* **Security**: Prevent flashing wrong disks, elevate permissions safely, checksum every image
* **Polish**: A clean, professional-looking UI that’s beginner-friendly
* **Focus**: Only AcreetionOS ISOs, no multi-distro support yet

| **Installer Packaging**   | Windows/macOS/Linux native installers with signing/notarization (if feasible) |

---

## 🔒 Technical Notes

### Short-Term: Electron Path (MVP Build)

* Harden the current Electron app for permissions, drive selection, and error handling
* Add safety checks and checksum logic
* UX polish and native-feeling interface (even within Electron)
* Use Electron Builder for packaging

### Mid-Term: Research Track – Rust + Tauri

This is **not part of MVP**, but runs in parallel:

* Evaluate Rust backend for flashing logic and disk safety
* Tauri frontend for native look/feel, lower binary size
* Consider modular approach to support multi-distro + white-label

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

We’ll consider the MVP successful if we:

* Achieve ≥ 95% successful flash rate
* Reduce user-reported errors to < 5%
* Get positive install experience feedback (≥ 80% “easy to use”)
* Land 1 early conversation around white-labeling or OEM use

---

## ⏱ Timeline (Flexible)

| Phase                          | Timeline                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Audit current Electron version | Week 0–2                  |
| Implement security + polish    | Week 3–6                  |
| QA + Community Beta            | Week 7–8                  |
| Launch + Promote               | Week 9–10                 |
| Begin Rust/Tauri R\&D          | Week 11+ (optional track) |

---

## 🎤 Team Pitch

> **“We’ve got a great start — now let’s make it production-ready.”**

We already have a working USB flasher. That’s a win.
Now we harden it, polish it, and ship it for real.

Let’s:

* Keep building on the existing Electron app (no wasted work)
* Add the basics users expect: security, stability, polish
* Explore Rust + Tauri as a future-proof platform

This isn’t a rewrite-for-the-sake-of-it. It’s a dual-track approach:

* Ship something solid now
* Prepare for the future later

---

## 🔄 And Hey — This Might Go Nowhere (And That’s Okay)

Let’s be honest: this project might stall out. We might get it to MVP and decide that’s “good enough.” Or we might discover users don’t really need it.

That’s totally fine.

This is a low-pressure proposal with a clear path, not a forever commitment. We’ll treat it like an experiment — ship something, see how it feels, and decide what to do next together. No egos. No drama. Just honest work.

---

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Review this doc and share thoughts
2. Audit the current Electron app → what’s working, what’s not
3. Define MVP checklist and owners
4. Start building toward v1

# 🛣️ **Roadmap: From Hobby to Production-Ready Electron App**

### ✅ **Phase 1: Cleanup & Baseline Structure**

**Goal:** Make the codebase clean, understandable, and safe to collaborate on.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] ✅ **Create a clean file structure:**

  ```bash
  .
  ├── src/
  │   ├── main/         # Electron main process
  │   └── renderer/     # UI logic and frontend
  ├── public/           # Static assets (favicon, etc.)
  ├── dist/             # Build output
  ├── preload.js        # For secure IPC
  ├── package.json
  └── README.md
  ```
* [ ] ❌ **Remove all `.bak`, `.txt`, and unused backup files**
* [ ] 📄 **Add a `.gitignore`** to exclude `node_modules`, `.bak`, `dist/`, `.DS_Store`, etc.
* [ ] ⚙️ **Ensure a valid `package.json`**

  * Add project name, version, description, scripts
  * Add `main` field pointing to `src/main/main.js`

---

### 🛡 **Phase 2: Security & IPC Best Practices**

**Goal:** Secure the app and establish safe communication between processes.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] 🔐 **Add a `preload.js` file** with a secure `contextBridge`:

  ```js
  const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require('electron');
  contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
      startFlash: (devicePath) => ipcRenderer.invoke('start-flash', devicePath),
  });
  ```
* [ ] 🎯 Use `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false` in `BrowserWindow`
* [ ] 🧠 Refactor direct `ipcRenderer` usage in renderer code to go through `window.electronAPI`
* [ ] 📦 Consider using `electron-store` or `lowdb` for persistent config if needed

---

### 🖥️ **Phase 3: Frontend Polish & UX**

**Goal:** Improve the UI and separation of logic.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] ✅ Move `index.html` and `renderer.js` into `src/renderer/`
* [ ] 🎨 Consider using a minimal UI framework (e.g., [Pico.css](https://picocss.com/), Tailwind, or plain Bootstrap)
* [ ] 🧩 Add status messages, device detection, and error feedback to the UI
* [ ] 🧪 Add dummy/mock flashing mode for dev testing

---

### 🧱 **Phase 4: Dev & Build Tooling**

**Goal:** Make it easy to build, run, and distribute the app.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] 📦 Add `electron-builder`:

  * Install via `npm install --save-dev electron-builder`
  * Update `package.json`:

    ```json
    "main": "src/main/main.js",
    "build": {
      "appId": "com.example.usbflasher",
      "files": [
        "dist/**/*",
        "src/**/*",
        "preload.js",
        "package.json"
      ],
      "directories": {
        "output": "release"
      }
    },
    "scripts": {
      "start": "electron .",
      "build": "electron-builder"
    }
    ```
* [ ] ✅ Add `README.md` with setup, build, and dev instructions
* [ ] (Optional) Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or Webpack for frontend bundling

---

### 🧪 **Phase 5: Testing & Distribution**

**Goal:** Prepare for shipping and contributions.

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Add `LICENSE` (MIT is already fine)
* [ ] Create test devices or mocks for flashing
* [ ] Set up GitHub/GitLab actions for CI builds
* [ ] Add installer targets (`.exe`, `.AppImage`, etc.)

---

## 🧩 Optional Future Improvements

When/if you want to go further:

* 🔄 Migrate to TypeScript for better safety
* 🔬 Add USB auto-detection (via `node-usb` or `usb-detection`)
* 🧰 Integrate logging (stdout + user-facing logs)
* 🔁 Tauri migration when Rust knowledge is stronger or size/security becomes a concern

---

## 🧷 TL;DR Contribution Plan

> This is what you could send as a polite PR pitch or issue:

> *"I'd love to contribute a few cleanup and quality-of-life improvements to your Electron USB flasher — mainly around organizing the file structure, improving security with preload.js, and preparing for builds with electron-builder. If you're open to it, I'd be happy to make it easier to maintain and grow."*

---

## My Suggested Personal TimeLine

If you're giving **a few hours per week** (say 4–6 hours total/week), you can absolutely get this project to a **professional baseline in \~4–6 weeks** — even faster if you skip UI polish or build tools and just focus on structure + security.

Here’s a clear **6-week roadmap**, optimized for limited but focused weekly effort:

---

## ⏳ **Week-by-Week Roadmap: Electron Flasher Professionalization**

### ✅ **Week 1: Baseline Cleanup (2–4 hrs)**

**Goal:** Clear structure, remove clutter, understand what’s there.

* [ ] Backup current repo and fork/clone
* [ ] Remove all `.bak`, `.txt`, and unused files
* [ ] Create proper folder structure:

  ```
  /src/main/        → main.js
  /src/renderer/    → index.html, renderer.js
  /public/          → preload.js (stubbed)
  ```
* [ ] Create a `.gitignore` for `node_modules`, `dist`, temp files
* [ ] Rewrite `README.md` with basic setup + run instructions

> 🔄 Outcome: You and others can now understand and run the app cleanly.

---

### 🔐 **Week 2: IPC & Security Hardening (4–6 hrs)**

**Goal:** Modernize Electron usage and isolate frontend/backend.

* [ ] Add a `preload.js` with `contextBridge` and safe IPC
* [ ] Refactor `renderer.js` to use `window.electronAPI` instead of `ipcRenderer`
* [ ] In `main.js`, use:

  ```js
  webPreferences: {
    preload: path.join(__dirname, '../../public/preload.js'),
    nodeIntegration: false,
    contextIsolation: true,
  }
  ```
* [ ] Double-check for `eval`, `require`, or dangerous code in UI

> 🔄 Outcome: Safer app with secure communication and less exposure risk.

---

### 💡 **Week 3: UI and Renderer Improvements (3–5 hrs)**

**Goal:** Tidy the frontend, improve UX a bit.

* [ ] Move all frontend logic into `src/renderer/`
* [ ] Break up UI logic in `renderer.js` for modularity (e.g., `deviceSelector.js`, `logger.js`)
* [ ] Add basic status display or console output
* [ ] Optional: apply minimal styling (Pico.css, Tailwind, etc.)

> 🔄 Outcome: Clearer and cleaner UI ready for users and future expansion.

---

### 🏗 **Week 4: Build Tooling (4–6 hrs)**

**Goal:** Make the app distributable and versioned.
